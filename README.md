# Footballer_Skills_GUI
This Python program has evolved from a Command Line Interface (CLI) to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Kivy framework. The application is designed for comprehensive football player evaluation, featuring an organized code structure that leverages Pythonâ€™s capabilities in a user-friendly environment.


## Description:
The Footballer_Skills.py CLI serves as the backbone of the application, showcasing essential Python principles and the flexibility of the language in computing. The program covers fundamental arithmetic, subroutines, and control flow, and has been developed into an advanced application with robust error and exception handling, all now presented in an intuitive GUI.

### Implement input function to collect player data for:
* [x] Speed
* [x] Shooting
* [x] Passing
* [x] Defending
* [x] Dribbling
* [x] Physicality
### Use an appropriate data structure to store:
* [x] Player skill ratings
* [x] Calculated overall rates
* [x] Corresponding salaries
### Calculate the overall rate using the formula:
* [x] Summation of skill ratings * 100 / 30
* [x] Implement salary estimation logic:
* [x] Overall rate >= 80: Salary = 1000
* [x] Overall rate == 60: Salary = 700
* [x] 45 <= Overall rate < 60: Salary options = 700, 500
* [x] Overall rate == 45: Salary = 500
* [x] 30 <= Overall rate < 45: Salary options = 500, 400
* [x] Overall rate <= 30: Salary = 400
* [x] Print the computed salary value(s) as integers.
### Ensure the program follows a clear structure with appropriate functions:
* [x] Function to collect input
* [x] Function to calculate overall rate
* [x] Function to determine salary
* [x] Function to output results
* [x] (Optional) Add validation and error handling for input values to ensure they are within the range 0-5.


## Flow chart for advanced Program:
* [x] Design pseudocode or draw a flowchart for the program.

## Solution for Advanced Program:

### Checklist for Functions:
* [x]  Split and pack up coursework 1 code into functions.
* [x]  Implement main() function.
* [x]  Implement calculate_rating() function.
* [x]  Implement calculate_salary() function.
* [x]  Use main() to call other functions:
* [x]  Receive 6 player skill ratings.
* [x]  Calculate the player's overall rating.
* [x]  Calculate the player's salary range.
### Checklist for Input Expansion
* [x]  Adjust the program to ask for:
* [x]  Player ID (2-digit number).
* [x]  Player name.
* [x]  Player date-of-birth (D.o.B) in ISO format (YEAR-MONTH-DATE).
* [x]  Ask for the 6 skills (speed, shooting, passing, defending, dribbling, physicality).
### Checklist for Looping the Code
#### Implement a loop to:
* [x]  Ask for information for three players, or
* [x]  Until the input for user ID is "end".
### Checklist for Calculating Overall Ratings
* [x]  Calculate the players' overall ratings.
* [x]  Store the overall ratings for later use.
### Checklist for Calculating Salary Ranges
* [x]  Calculate the players' salary ranges.
* [x]  Store the salary ranges for later use.
### Checklist for Calculating Players' Ages
* [x]  Calculate each player's age based on year of birth.
* [x]  Store the age for later use.
### Checklist for Tabulating Data
* [x]  Use the tabulate library to display a table summarizing input data in ascending order of user ID.
* [x]  Table columns: UID, Name, D.o.B, Age, Score, Salary Range.
### Checklist for File Writing
* [x]  Save the summary table into a local file named "players.txt".
### Checklist for Input Validation
* [x]  Implement robust input validation:
* [x]  Validate player ID.
* [x]  Validate D.o.B.
* [x]  Validate ratings.
* [x]  Display warning "The rating you entered was invalid" for any input errors.
### Checklist for Data Structures
* [x]  Use appropriate data structures for storing player information.
### Checklist for Code Structures
* [x]  Use appropriate code structures for implementing the functionality.
### Checklist for Distinction Advanced Function
* [x]  Implement advanced() function:
* [x]  Serve as a complimentary main() method.
* [x]  Use the provided file as input instead of user input.
* [x]  Accept filename as an argument.
* [x]  Read user information record from provided file "PlayerData.txt".
* [x]  Use this data as input for the program.
* [x]  Call all other functions and produce a text file output.
